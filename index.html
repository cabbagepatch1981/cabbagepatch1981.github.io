  <h3 id="headline">From 1951 to today... Edina through the decades:</h3>
  <ul id="summary">
    <li>Edwina Margaret Rose arrives on 6 August 1951.</li>
    <li>The sixties might be swinging for everyone else, but Edwina's mother, Mrs M., prefers an overprotective, suburban environment for her daughter, full of jam roly poly pudding and endless cups of sugary tea.</li>
    <li>At some point Edwina decides to go by the name Edina - her mother continues to call her Edwina to this day - but is more often known by her nickname Eddie (her past nickname of 'The Shredder' has fallen into disuse).</li>
    <li>During her teens, Eddie develops a life-long friendship with future fashion editor Patsy Stone.  When not at home with Mrs M. and her father, Eddie's lives centre around the 'what's hip and what's happening' of 1960s and '70s counter-culture</li>
    <li>In the late 1960s or early 1970s, Eddie settles down briefly and marries Malcolm Turtle.  They have their son, Serge, together but divorce soon follows.</li> 
    <li>The mid-1970s see Edina try marriage for a second time, this time to Justin, with whom she has her daughter, Saffron (Saffy).</li>
    <li>Edina and Justin divorce; Justin has a big part in Saffron's life and he and his boyfriend annoy Edina.</li>
    <li>In the 1980s, Edina's son Serge leaves home for good.  They reunite years later.  Serge is now a bookseller in New York and has a boyfriend who admires Edina.</li>
    <li>Also in the 1980s, Edina opens Monsoon PR and represents clients such as LuLu, Twiggy and Emma Bunton, as well as Prozac and PopSpecs.</li>
    <li>Edina has a house in a constant-cycle of redecoration in Holland Park (definitely <em>not</em> in Shepherd's Bush).</li>
    <li>Edina and her friend Patsy remain as inseparable in later life as they were in the swinging '60s.</li>
    <li>Other key people in Edina's life are her mother, Saffron, Serge, her two ex-husbands, and her PA, Bubble.</li>
